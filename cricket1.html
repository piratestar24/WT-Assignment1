                            <p><strong>About Rahul:</strong>Young KL Rahul is amongst the most talented opening batsmen in India’s next generation setup. He was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. He has never been one of those cricketers who has set the stage on fire or has been the talk of the town for his batting skills. Rahul has taken gentle strides over the years and made a name for himself for being a consistent performer in the domestic circles. He enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.</p>

                            <p><strong>About Hardik:</strong>If there is one thing that separates Hardik Pandya from other young cricketers, it is his immense self-belief. The flamboyant Baroda all-rounder never lets pressure affect his game, but instead relishes such situations. A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an all-rounder. It was no surprise that he was fast tracked into the Indian ODI and T20 side after a successful run in the IPL 2015.</p>

                            <p><strong>About Yadav:</strong>There’s no limit to the range of shots Suryakumar Yadav has to offer when he walks out to bat. Nicknamed the modern 360-batter, the right-handed batter makes batting look effortless when he times the ball to perfection all around the park. After some supreme knocks in domestic cricket, Suryakumar Yadav made his international debut against England.

An eccentric fielder, a more than handy left-arm spinner and a fearless batsman, Jadeja had all the qualities of a utility cricketer.
