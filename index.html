        <h2>The History of Cricket</h2>
        <div class="history">
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that originated in England during the 16th century. It has since evolved into
                one of the most popular sports globally, with millions of fans and players.</p>

            <p>The game is played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players. The objective is to score runs by
                hitting the ball and running between wickets, while the opposing team tries to dismiss the batsmen and
                limit the runs scored.</p>

            <p>Cricket has a rich history, witnessing various formats like Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and
                Twenty20 (T20) matches. Iconic players, unforgettable moments, and thrilling matches have contributed to
                the sport's allure.</p>

            <p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England. It became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association football (soccer).</p>

            <P>The first ever international cricket game was between the US and Canada in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of the St George's Cricket Club in New York</P>
            <p>In 1877, an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural Test matches. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at The Oval in 1882, the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to The Ashes.</p>
            <P>The game of cricket was exported to other colonies around the world. The Imperial Cricket Conference was founded in 1909 with England, Australia and South Africa as the founder members. It had been set up with the Marylebone Cricket club, the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket, and the South African Cricket Association as the original associations of the ICC. This aimed to regulate international cricket between the three sides, considered the only three of equal status at the time. In 1926, both New Zealand and the West Indies were admitted as members, allowing them to play Test cricket against the other sides. However, at this time in the West Indies, cricket was primarily dominated by the white population. Originally, the ICC was not interested in broadening the international popularity of cricket. The organization was reluctant to invite non-commonwealth nations to play. New Zealand was restricted to play three-day test matches.New Zealand and India both became Test playing nations before World War II and Pakistan joined soon afterwards in 1952.</P>
            <P>At the initial suggestion of Pakistan, the ICC was expanded to include non-Test playing countries from 1965, with Associate members being admitted. At the same time the organisation changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. The first limited-overs World Cups were played during the 1970s and Sri Lanka became the first Associate member to be raised to Test playing status in 1982. Because the ICC was predominantly a Western organization, the founding countries decided who was allowed to join the conference or engage in test cricket. There was no desire or attempt to create a set of Associate nations that would play in Test status, which is why countries such as Sri Lanka were not permitted to partake until the 1980s</P>
